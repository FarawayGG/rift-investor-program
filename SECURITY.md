# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Faraway team takes the security of our software seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the Rift Investor Program, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to us via email at support@faraway.gg or through our security page at https://github.com/FarawayGG/rift-investor-program/security.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason other than testing
- Report any vulnerability you've discovered promptly
- Do not use any automated tools to find vulnerabilities

## Scope

The following are in scope for security reports:
- Solana program code (programs/token-time-lock-agreement)
- Smart contract logic vulnerabilities
- Cryptographic weaknesses in the protocol

Out of scope issues include:
- UI/UX bugs or issues
- Network congestion or performance issues not caused by vulnerabilities in our code
- Issues in third-party dependencies that are already publicly known
- Social engineering attacks

## Updates

We will update this document as necessary to reflect changes in our security policy or to add additional information about how to report vulnerabilities.

Thank you for helping to keep our project and our users secure!
